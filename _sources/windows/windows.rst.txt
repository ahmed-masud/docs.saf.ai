Integrating with Microsoft Windows
==================================

If it's your first time working with CEFS, please consider deploying it on a
standalone environment before integrating it with :doc:`Active Directory Integration <active-directory-integration>`.

Simple Setup
============

-----------------------------------------

If you are integrating with Active Directory, please STOP and follow the instructions provided in :doc:`active-directory-integration`.


Installation
============

The easiest way to integrate with Microsoft Windows networks is to simply
configure a samba service on your CEFS file-server with a selected number of common shares.

This method is also good for creating an environment that will integrate
with LDAP or RADIUS based authentications.

Please go through :doc:`CEFS Installation </installation>` and configure a 
CEFS file-server before continuing.
