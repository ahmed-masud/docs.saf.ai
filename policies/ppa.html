<li><p>Non-Exclusive Arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything else in this PPA or any Addendum, this PPA is a non-exclusive arrangement, and neither party shall be prevented from pursuing other work or opportunities, including competitive opportunities during or after the Term, so long as such party does not breach any term of this PPA (including without limitation provisions governing confidentiality and intellectual property) in pursuing such opportunity.</p></li>

</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Confidential Information.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Definition. “Confidential Information” means: any business or
technical information disclosed by either party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other (“Receiving Party”) that is designated as confidential at the time of disclosure or that, under the circumstances, a person exercising reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary, including but not limited to: (i) any (a) business, commercial, operational, management or financial information, customer lists, price lists, data, processes, models, personnel data and any other data or know how; and any (b) analyses, compilations and other material prepared by the Receiving Party which contain, reflect or are generated from the information described in (b) above; (ii) any information that either party derives relating to the conduct or performance of the other party’s personnel, services or systems, and any information that either party conveys to the other party concerning data security measures, incidents, or findings; (iii) the specific terms set forth in this PPA; and (iv) (m) all elements of the sāf.ai Services, including any non-public roadmap, (n) any sāf.ai Materials, and (o) the Fees, as well as any related discounts (each of which are considered to be sāf.ai’s Confidential Information). Unless sāf.ai Materials are explicitly marked ‘for distribution to Customers’ or as otherwise agreed by sāf.ai, sāf.ai Materials should be treated as Confidential Information not intended to be made public or shared with third parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclusions. The obligations in Section 10.3 will not apply to the
extent any information: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault of or breach of this PPA by the receiving party; (ii) is rightfully known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure.</p></li>
<li><p>Use and Disclosure Restrictions. The Receiving Party will not use the
Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except as necessary for the performance or enforcement of this PPA and will not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party except to those of its employees and subcontractors who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance or enforcement of this PPA; provided that each such employee and subcontractor is bound by a written agreement that contains use and disclosure restrictions consistent with the terms set forth in this Section. Each receiving party will protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure using efforts equivalent to the efforts that the receiving party ordinarily uses with respect to its own Confidential Information and in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either party from disclosing the other party’s Confidential Information or the terms and conditions of this PPA: (i) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable prior notice to the other party to enable it to contest such order or requirement unless legally prohibited; (ii) on a confidential basis to its legal or professional financial advisors; (iii) as required under applicable securities regulations, provided that the party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable prior notice to the other party unless legally prohibited; or (iv) on a confidential basis to present or future providers of venture capital and/or potential private investors in or acquirers of such party, provided that any such persons are bound by a written agreement that contains use and disclosure restrictions consistent with the terms set forth in this Section.</p></li>
<li><p>Remedies. Any use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential
Information in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement may cause the Disclosing Party irreparable damage for which remedies other than injunctive relief may be inadequate, and both parties agree that the Disclosing Party may request injunctive or other equitable relief seeking to restrain such use or disclosure.</p></li>
