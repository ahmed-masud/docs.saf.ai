In furtherance of this purpose, Licensee shall provide feedback to sāf.ai concerning the functionality and performance of the Beta Software from time to time as reasonably requested by sāf.ai, including, without limitation, identifying potential errors and improvements (collectively, the “Feedback”). Licensee will provide Feedback in a manner that is mutually agreeable to the parties. sāf.ai may use Feedback, without restriction in any manner now known or in the future conceived, to improve or enhance its products and, accordingly, and you hereby grant to sāf.ai a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, worldwide right and license, with the right to sublicense</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">

TO SĀF.AI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Support Services</strong>. sāf.ai is under no obligation to support the

copyright notice accompanying such Open Source Software or included in
the open source licenses file accompanying the Beta Software.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>TERM AND TERMINATION.
Unless otherwise terminated as specified under this Agreement,
Licensee’s rights with respect to the Beta Software will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the date on which Licensee breaches any of the terms of this Beta Agreement, or (ii) 45 day automatic expiration of the Beta Software License based on the system date. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason by providing the other party advance written notice thereof. Licensee agrees that this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice in the event Licensee discloses the Beta Software in breach of Section 4 (Confidentiality) below. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and Licensee shall immediately cease using, and will destroy or render practically inaccessible the Beta Software, Documentation, and all other tangible items in Licensee’s possession or control that contain Confidential Information. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason.</p></li>
<li><p>CONFIDENTIALITY.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>“Confidential Information” shall mean the Beta Software, all
information regarding the Beta Software (including any trade secrets,
know-how, inventions, techniques, processes, and algorithms embodied
in the Beta Software), Documentation, Performance Data, any Updates,
sāf.ai products, product roadmaps, and other technical, business,
financial and product development plans, forecasts and strategies, and
other information provided by sāf.ai to Licensee under this Agreement,
whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by examination or inspection,
other than information that Licensee can demonstrate:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>was already known to Licensee, other than under an obligation
of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure;</p></li>
<li><p>was generally available in the public domain at the time of
disclosure to Licensee;</p></li>
<li><p>became generally available in the public domain after
disclosure other than through any act or omission of Licensee;</p></li>
<li><p>was subsequently lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third
party without any obligation of confidentiality; <em>or</em></p></li>
<li><p>was independently developed by Licensee without use of or
reference to any information or materials disclosed by sāf.ai
or its suppliers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If Licensee wishes to disclose to sāf.ai any information under this
Agreement that Licensee considers proprietary or confidential to
Licensee (“Licensee Information”), then Licensee agrees such disclosure
will be governed by a separate non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) by and
between the parties.</p>
<p>If Licensee is required to disclose Confidential Information by
applicable law or court order, Licensee shall notify sāf.ai of the
required disclosure promptly in writing and shall cooperate with sāf.ai
in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of the required
disclosure. Licensee shall not use any Confidential Information for any
purpose other than as expressly authorized under this Agreement.
In no event shall Licensee use the Beta Software or any Confidential
Information to develop, manufacture, market, sell, or distribute any
product or service, including any sāf.ai products except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement. Licensee shall not disclose any
Confidential Information to any third party. Without limiting the
foregoing, Licensee shall use at least the same degree of care that it
uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of
like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care, to prevent
the disclosure of such Confidential Information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional Confidentiality Restrictions for Highly Confidential Beta
Software. For certain Beta Software designated by sāf.ai in writing as
highly confidential (“Highly Confidential Beta Software”), Licensee
agrees that the following, additional confidentiality obligations and
restrictions will apply:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Licensee shall limit dissemination of Highly Confidential Beta
Software and related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps only to Information Technology teams and/or software/solutions development teams of Licensee approved in writing by sāf.ai, and only to individuals on such teams on a need-to-know basis and solely for purposes expressly authorized under this Agreement. For clarity and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not disseminate any Highly Confidential Beta Software to Licensee’s sales and marketing field organizations. Licensee will assign an employee who will be primarily responsible for ensuring Licensee’s full compliance with the terms described in this Section 4(b) herein.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Improper Disclosure of Highly Confidential Beta Software.
Licensee acknowledges that damages due to Licensee’s improper disclosure of Highly Confidential Beta Software or related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps may be irreparable and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate sāf.ai for any breach of this Agreement. In the event that sāf.ai reasonably believes that Licensee has disseminated Highly Confidential Beta Software or related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps to an unauthorized party, Licensee will be immediately removed from sāf.ai’s Beta Software program and will not be permitted to participate in any sāf.ai Beta Software program in the future. Additionally, all rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate in accordance with Section 3 herein (Term and Termination), and (b) in addition to all other remedies available in law or otherwise, sāf.ai is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
