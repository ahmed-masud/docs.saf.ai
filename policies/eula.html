<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>was already known to Licensee, other than under an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure;</p></li>
<li><p>was generally available in the public domain at the time of disclosure to Licensee;</p></li>
<li><p>became generally available in the public domain after disclosure other than through any act or omission of Licensee;</p></li>
<li><p>was subsequently lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) was independently developed by Licensee without use of or reference to any information or materials disclosed by sāf.ai or its suppliers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Licensee shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party except as expressly provided in this Agreement, and shall use at least the same degree of care that it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care, to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information.</p>
<p>If Licensee wishes to disclose to sāf.ai any information under the Agreement that Licensee considers proprietary or confidential to Licensee (“<strong>Licensee Information</strong>”), then Licensee agrees such disclosure will be governed by a separate non-disclosure agreement (“<strong>NDA</strong>”) by and between the parties.</p>

<p>Licensee acknowledges that damages due to Licensee’s improper disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate sāf.ai for any breach of this Agreement. The parties agree that sāf.ai shall be entitled to relief both at law and in equity, including injunctive relief and specific performance, in the event of any non-permitted disclosure or threatened non-permitted disclosure without proof of any actual or special damages and without the requirement that sāf.ai post a bond or other surety in connection with any such injunctive relief.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any breach or threatened breach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement would be a material breach of this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.
sāf.ai warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from installation the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation (“Warranty”).  Licensee’s exclusive remedy and sāf.ai’s entire obligation liability for any breach of the Warrantee is to repair or replace the software or refund to Licensee the price Licensee paid for the Software if a repair or replacement of the Software would, in sāf.ai’s opinion, be unreasonable. The Warranty is conditioned upon Licensee providing sāf.ai with prompt written notice of the failure of the Software to perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation.</p>
<p>The Warranty shall not apply if (i) the Software is not used in accordance with the Documentation or this Agreement; (ii) any part of the Software has been modified by any entity other than sāf.ai; or (iii) a malfunction in the Software has been caused by any equipment or software not supplied by sāf.ai.</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTY, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SĀF.AI MAKES NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND REGARDING THE SOFTWARE AND DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES, OR EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING the IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. SĀF.AI MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR GUARANTEE AS TO THE SOFTWARE’S USE OR PERFORMANCE, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE FAIL-SAFE, UNINTERRUPTED OR FREE FROM ERRORS OR DEFECTS</strong>.</p>

SĀF.AI HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND LICENSEE SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SĀF.AI FROM, ALL CLAIMS, SUITS, DEMANDS, AND PROCEEDINGS ALLEGING, CLAIMING, SEEKING, OR ASSERTING ANY LIABILITY, LOSS, OBLIGATION, RISK, COST, DAMAGE, AWARD, PENALTY, SETTLEMENT, JUDGMENT, FINE, OR EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES) ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH LICENSEE’S USE OF THE SOFTWARE ON OR IN A HIGH-RISK SYSTEM</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  FOR THE BASE VERSION, EACH PARTY’S ENTIRE AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR CLAIMS UNDER OR RELATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL PAYMENTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY LICENSEE TO SĀF.AI IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM. FOR THE COMMUNITY EDITION, EACH PARTY’S ENTIRE AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR CLAIMS UNDER OR RELATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100 USD). TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSEE OR SĀF.AI OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE LIABILITY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, STATUTE, CONTRACT OR OTHER), EVEN IF SĀF.AI AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS DUE TO SĀF.AI IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THIS LIMITATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT SĀF.AI WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON ITS LIABILITY</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>INDEMNIFICATION</p>
<p>Licensee shall indemnify and defend sāf.ai and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, and affiliates against all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorney fees, as a result of or in connection with</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Licensee’s failure to obtain any consent, authorization, or license required for sāf.ai’s use or handling of data, software, materials, systems, networks, or the technology provided by Licensee;</p></li>
<li><p>Licensee’s use of the Software in a manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement including any manner inconsistent with the Documentation;</p></li>
<li><p>any violation by Licensee of applicable laws; <em>and</em></p></li>
<li><p>any reasonable costs and attorney fees required for sāf.ai to respond to a subpoena, court order, or other official government inquiry regarding Licensee’s use of the Software.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>sāf.ai shall indemnify and defend Licensee against third party claims asserted against Licensee in a suit or action for direct patent infringement, direct copyright infringement, or direct trade secret misappropriation</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, sāf.ai shall not indemnify or defend Licensee for claims asserted, in whole or in part, against</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>technology, designs, or requirements given by Licensee to sāf.ai, <em>or</em></p></li>
<li><p>any modification to the Software made by anyone other than sāf.ai.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>sāf.ai may, at its sole discretion and at its own expense, with respect to any Software that is subject to a claim</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>procure Licensee with the right to continue using the Software;</p></li>
<li><p>replace the Software with a non-infringing version of the Software; <em>or</em></p></li>
<li><p>modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Promptly upon learning of any claim for which indemnification is sought from the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party of such claim and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information known and reasonably available to the indemnified party related to such claim; provided that any failure to comply with the provisions of this clause shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the indemnifying party. Through counsel of its own choosing, the indemnified party has the right to participate in (but not control the defense of) any proceeding in which it is being indemnified under this Agreement, but in such event the indemnified party will be solely responsible for paying the legal fees and expenses for its own counsel. The indemnifying party will, however, continue to be solely responsible for all other expenses relating to the action, including legal fees and expenses of the counsel it selects to defend the claims. The indemnifying party shall not take any action, which unreasonably exposes the indemnified party to a risk of damages, which would not be covered by such indemnity, and may not settle any matter without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.</p>
