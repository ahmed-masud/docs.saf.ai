<h2>Terms of Service<a class="headerlink" href="#terms-of-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and any accompanying or future Order Form you enter into with sāf.ai, Inc. (“sāf.ai” or “we”) issued under these Terms (together with these Terms, the “Agreement”) govern your access to and use of the services provided to you by sāf.ai (the “sāf.ai Services”). As set forth in an Order Form or as otherwise agreed to by sāf.ai, the sāf.ai Services may include one or more of the following: (a) subscription software data processing services (the “Platform Services”), (b) subscription support services (“Support Services”), (c) training services (the “Training Services”), (d) professional services (the “Professional Services”), or (e) any other services the parties agree in an Order Form that sāf.ai will provide. If you are acting on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case “Customer,” “you,” or “your” shall refer to that entity (otherwise, such terms refer to you as an individual). By accepting these Terms, either by executing these Terms separately or by executing an initial Order Form that indicates your acceptance of these Terms (an “Initial Order Form”), whether by signature or by clicking an “I Accept” button or checkbox, you agree in full to these Terms. If you do not have authority to bind your entity or do not agree with these Terms, you must not accept these Terms and may not use the sāf.ai Services. The “Effective Date” of these Terms is the earliest to occur of the effective date of the Initial Order Form, the date you execute these Terms, or the date you first access or use the sāf.ai Services.</p>
<p>In the event of conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence is as follows: (1) the Order Form; (2) a statement of work mutually agreed by by both parties, as applicable (“<strong>SOW</strong>”); (3) this Terms of Services agreement.</p>

<li><p>“<strong>Cloud Provider</strong>” means, unless specified otherwise in an Order
Form, Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”).</p></li>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer acknowledges that any Reseller Order is subject to sāf.ai’s prior approval and agrees that no term in any Reseller Order will be deemed to modify the Agreement unless pre-authorized in writing by sāf.ai.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Subscription Services</strong>.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p><strong>Authorized Users</strong>.</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p><strong>Selecting Authorized Users</strong>. If we have agreed to provide you with Subscription Services, you may select Authorized Users to access and use the Subscription Services, subject to the restrictions set forth below and to any numeric or other limits established in an Order Form or as otherwise agreed to by the parties. You must obtain separate credentials (user IDs and passwords) via the Subscription Services for each Authorized User.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your Responsibilities Regarding Authorized Users</strong>. You shall at all times be responsible for and expressly assume the risks associated with all use of the Subscription Services under an Authorized User’s account (including for the payment of Fees related to such use), whether such action was taken by an Authorized User or by another party, and whether or not such action was authorized by an Authorized User, provided that such action was not (1) taken by sāf.ai or by a party acting under the direction of sāf.ai or (2) an action by a third party that sāf.ai should reasonably have prevented. This responsibility includes the security of each Authorized User’s credentials, and you shall not share (and shall instruct each Authorized User not to share) such credentials with any other person or entity, or otherwise permit any other person or entity to access or use the Subscription Services, except to the extent permitted in an Order Form.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Provision of the Subscription Services</strong>. Subject to your, and
your Authorized Users’, compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of any Fees as due under Section 5 (Payment)), sāf.ai will provide you with the Subscription Services, and you and your Authorized Users may access and use the Subscription Services solely for your internal business purposes, unless any other permitted use is set forth in an applicable Order Form. sāf.ai reserves the right to improve or otherwise modify its internal System architecture at any time subject to maintaining appropriate industry standards of practice relating to the provision and security of the Subscription Services, and provided that any such modification does not materially diminish the core functionality of the Subscription Services. As between the parties, you retain all ownership rights in Customer Data, Customer Results and, subject to sāf.ai rights in Usage Data (as defined in Section 3.3(a)), Customer Instructional Input, and any other information or materials you provide to sāf.ai to enable sāf.ai to perform any of the sāf.ai Services. Additionally, to the extent Customer utilizes third party open source libraries within the Customer Instructional Input, the foregoing shall not be read to imply ownership by Customer in such libraries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shared Responsibility Deployment</strong>.</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p><strong>Generally</strong>. You acknowledge that the Platform Services
are implemented in a manner that divides the Platform Services between the Customer Cloud Environment and the sāf.ai Control Plane, and that accordingly each party must undertake certain technical and organizational measures in order to protect the Platform Services and the Customer Content. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer acknowledges and agrees that (1) in order to utilize the Platform Services, Customer must have an account with the Cloud Provider; (2) sāf.ai does not host the Customer Cloud Environment into which the Platform Services are deployed or the Systems in which your Customer Data may be stored (e.g., an AWS S3 bucket); (3) while certain Customer Data may occasionally be present within the Platform Services (e.g., within the Customer Results), the Platform Services are not designed to archive or permanently retain Customer Data, but merely to provide an environment to facilitate Customer’s processing of Customer Data within the Customer Cloud Environment by permitting Customer to generate and execute Customer Instructional Input and view Customer Results; and (4) sāf.ai and the Platform Services do not provide backup services or disaster recovery to enable recovery of Customer Data. Accordingly, and without limiting the foregoing, but subject to Section 9.1, sāf.ai is not responsible for any loss, destruction, alteration, or corruption of Customer Content, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of sāf.ai or to the extent caused by any third party that sāf.ai should reasonably have prevented from having access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customer Responsibilities</strong>. Customer acknowledges and
agrees that Customer is responsible for (1) protecting the security of all Customer credentials used to access the Subscription Services (with sāf.ai also responsible for taking adequate steps to protect Customer credentials to the extent such credentials are within the control of sāf.ai); (2) securing the Customer Cloud Environment and any Customer System (with such steps to include without limitation the regular rotation of access keys and other industry standard steps to preclude unauthorized access); (3) backing up Customer Instructional Input (e.g., via Github or other third party system); (4) backing up and securing Customer Data under Customer’s control within the Customer Cloud Environment or other Customer controlled System (e.g., by turning on versioning and encryption within AWS S3); and (5) any security or other issues resulting from any Customer Instructional Input, and Customer expressly assumes the risks associated with the foregoing responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sāf.ai Responsibilities</strong>. sāf.ai acknowledges and
agrees that, as between the parties and except to the extent caused by the action or intentional or negligent inaction of Customer or Customer’s Authorized Users, including without limitation any customizations or configurations of the Platform Services by Customer or anything specified to be Customer’s responsibility in (ii), above, sāf.ai is primarily responsible for (1) the operation (excluding to the extent such operation is directed by the Customer Instructional Content) of the sāf.ai Control Plane (including the user interface of the Platform Services and the portion of the Platform Services within the sāf.ai Control Plane in which the Customer Instructional Input and Customer Results are held until deleted by Customer) and the sāf.ai software that operates the computing resources in the Customer Data Plane; and (2) implementing reasonable technical and organizational measures designed in accordance with the ISMS Standard (defined below) to protect the security of the foregoing. Additionally, while it is Customer’s responsibility to back up Customer Instructional Input, sāf.ai will, at Customer’s reasonable request, provide commercially reasonable assistance with recovery efforts where reasonably possible.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Training Services</strong>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Generally</strong>. sāf.ai may provide, as set forth in an Order
Form, certain Training Services, delivered (i) by instructors (“Instructor-led Training Services”), either in person or online-only; or (ii) as a self-paced online training course (“Self-Paced Training Services”). If we have agreed to provide you with Training Services, we will provide qualified training personnel and/or suitable training materials. You shall make available to sāf.ai any materials sāf.ai reasonably requires to perform the Training Services, but unless agreed between the parties in writing, shall not provide sāf.ai any Customer Data for use with the Training Services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instructor-led Training Services</strong>. If we have agreed to
provide you with Instructor-led Training Services, except as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties, you shall, as reasonably applicable: (i) provide qualified personnel to assist in coordinating and implementing the Instructor-led Training Services; (ii) provide sāf.ai with access to your sites and facilities (or temporary off-site facilities) during normal business hours and as otherwise reasonably required by sāf.ai to perform the Instructor-led Training Services; (iii) provide sāf.ai with such working space and office support (including access to telephones, photocopying equipment, and the like) as sāf.ai may reasonably request; and (iv) perform your duties and tasks as may be reasonably required to permit sāf.ai to perform the Instructor-led Training Services, including any such duties and tasks that may be set forth in an Order Form.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Paced Training Services</strong>. sāf.ai may make available
certain Self-Paced Training Services. Unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form or when signing up for a Self-Paced Training Service, the Self-Paced Training Services shall expire 12 months from the earlier of purchase or activation and are licensed on a per-user basis.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Professional Services</strong>. Terms regarding the delivery of
Professional Services, if applicable, shall be set forth in an Order Form.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p><strong>Generally</strong>. Subject to the Order Form, sāf.ai will provide Professional Services designed to initiate and/or facilitate your ability to effectively utilize saf.ai platform.

<li><p><strong>Expenses</strong>. You agree to reimburse sāf.ai for reasonable travel and lodging expenses actually incurred by sāf.ai</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong>.</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>sāf.ai, upon your payment of all fees and charges accruing under the Order Form, grants you a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, or create derivative works based on any Professional Services work product delivered hereunder by sāf.ai to you, as may be further described in an SOW (the “<strong>Deliverables</strong>”). If and to the extent sāf.ai incorporates any <strong>sāf.ai Materials</strong> (as defined below) into the Deliverables, sāf.ai grants to you a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify or create  derivative works based on such sāf.ai Materials, solely as incorporated into the Deliverables and solely for your internal or external business use as reasonably necessary to use the Deliverables for their intended purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, no part of the Platform Services shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Deliverables.</p></li>
<li><p>Subject to your rights in your Confidential Information, sāf.ai will exclusively own all rights, title and interest in and to: (i) the Deliverables; and (ii) any software programs, tools, utilities, processes, inventions, devices, methodologies, specifications, documentation, techniques, training materials, and other materials of any kind used or developed by sāf.ai or its personnel in connection with performing the Professional Services, or any other sāf.ai Services (collectively “<strong>sāf.ai Materials</strong>”), including all Intellectual Property Rights in any of the foregoing.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless otherwise set forth in the Order Form or an SOW, the Deliverables are not subject to any maintenance, support or updates after the termination of the Order Form.</p></li>

The Indemnitor will not settle any claim in a manner that does not fully discharge the claim against an Indemnitee or that imposes any obligation on, or restricts any right of, an Indemnitee without the Indemnitee’s prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. An Indemnitee has the right to retain counsel, at the Indemnitee’s expense, to participate in the defense or settlement of any claim.
